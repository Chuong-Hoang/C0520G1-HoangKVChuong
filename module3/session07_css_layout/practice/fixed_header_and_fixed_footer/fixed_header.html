        <p>I have been in love and been alone<br>
            I have traveled over many miles to find a home<br>
            There's that little place inside of me<br>
            That I never thought could take control of everything<br>
            But now I just spend all my time with anyone<br>
            Who makes me feel the way she does<br>
            'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night<br>
            Even though she's not real it's all right<br>
            'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night<br>
            Every move that she makes holds my eyes<br>
            And I fall for her every time</p>

        <p>I've so many things I want to say<br>
            I'll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way<br>
            I had never known what's right for me<br>
            Till the night she opened up my heart and set it free<br>
            But now I just spend all my time with anyone<br>
            Who makes me feel the way she does<br>
            'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night<br>
            Even though she's not real it's all right<br>
            'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night<br>
            Every move that she makes holds my eyes<br>
            And I fall for her every time</p>
